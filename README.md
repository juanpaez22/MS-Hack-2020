Enlighten is a browser extension designed to bring mental health to the forefront of our workdays in this new normal. It is extremely easy to get lost in the virtual workplace and put our mental health in the back burner. To solve this, Enlighten reminds you to rate your mood daily and track your history for increased awareness of your own mental health. It also provides easy access to common resources that relate to mindfulness, dealing with anxiety/sadness, and building good habits. As a bonus, Enlighten offers a configurable workday end reminder to ensure users avoid burnout and overworking.

To set up the working prototype:
- Clone this repository
- Go to chrome://extensions or edge://extensions
- Turn on developer mode, select "load unpacked", and upload the "dist" folder from the repository.
- You should see the extension in the upper left corner of your screen!
